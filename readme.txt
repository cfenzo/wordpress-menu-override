Override page level menus with this plugin. On a page by page basis you can leave your navigation menu the default, choose different menus for each page, or have a page inherit from its parent. This plugin is particularly useful when you want to have section level navigation menus but your theme does not support it.

== Description ==

On medium to large sites there is often a need to have a "global navigation" menu that exists at the top of every page of the site and then have section level navigation menus on various pages of the site. Not many themes allow you to do this so I created this plugin to fix that.

== Installation ==

Simply install the plugin through the Wordpress plugin manager. If you are not able to do so automatically, you an also download the plugin and put it in the wp-contet/plugins folder.

After the plugin is installed you'll have a new option when editing pages in the right column to select which menu should be displayed on the page.
